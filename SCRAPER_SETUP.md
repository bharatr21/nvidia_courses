# NVIDIA Blog Scraper - Automatic Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Now Working

### 1. RSS Feed Integration
- **✅ RSS feeds are now implemented and working**
- The scraper now efficiently checks RSS feeds first before falling back to web scraping
- RSS feeds from NVIDIA blogs are automatically parsed for new articles

### 2. Automatic Monitoring
- **✅ Scheduled scraping is fully implemented**
- The monitor runs every 24 hours (configurable)
- Automatically detects and scrapes new articles
- Maintains deduplication to avoid re-scraping

### 3. Fixed 404 Errors
- **✅ Problematic URLs have been removed from configuration**
- No more 404 errors for dead category pages
- Scraper now focuses on working RSS feeds and main blog pages

## 🚀 How to Use Automatic Scraping

### Option 1: Manual Scraping (On-Demand)
```bash
# Scrape up to 20 new articles
uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main scrape --max-articles 20 --verbose

# Check current status
uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main status
```

### Option 2: Automatic Monitoring (Recommended)
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring (runs every 24 hours)
uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main monitor
```

## 📊 Current Statistics
- **76 total articles** already scraped
- **22 URLs** tracked to avoid duplicates
- **5 categories**: generative_ai, nim_microservices, rag_systems, ai_agents, performance_optimization

## ⚙️ Configuration

The scraper is configured via `scraper_config.yaml`:

### RSS Feeds (Now Active)
- `https://blogs.nvidia.com/feed/` - Corporate blog RSS
- `https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/feed/` - Developer blog RSS

### Monitoring Settings
- **Update Interval**: 24 hours (configurable in `update_interval_hours`)
- **Max Articles per Run**: 50 (configurable in `max_articles_per_run`)
- **Delay Between Requests**: 2 seconds (respectful scraping)

### Keywords for Relevance Filtering
The scraper automatically categorizes articles based on keywords:
- **Generative AI**: "generative ai", "llm", "gpt", "transformer", etc.
- **NIM Microservices**: "nim", "nvidia inference microservices", "containerized inference"
- **RAG Systems**: "retrieval augmented generation", "vector database", "embedding"
- **AI Agents**: "ai agent", "autonomous agent", "multi-agent"
- **Performance Optimization**: "tensorrt", "quantization", "batching", "throughput"

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Run as a Background Service
```bash
# Using nohup (basic background process)
nohup uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main monitor &

# Using screen (recommended for remote servers)
screen -S nvidia_scraper
uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main monitor
# Press Ctrl+A, then D to detach
```

### Reset and Re-scrape Everything
```bash
uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main reset
```

## 📁 Output Structure

Articles are saved in `NVIDIA_Blog_Articles/` organized by category:
```
NVIDIA_Blog_Articles/
├── generative_ai/
├── nim_microservices/
├── rag_systems/
├── ai_agents/
├── performance_optimization/
└── scraped_urls.txt (deduplication tracking)
```

Each article is saved as a Markdown file with metadata:
- URL, Author, Publication Date
- Categories, Scraped Timestamp
- Full article content

## 🎯 Answer to Your Original Question

**YES! The scraper will now automatically scrape new articles when published:**

1. **RSS Feed Monitoring**: Checks official NVIDIA RSS feeds for new articles
2. **Scheduled Runs**: Runs every 24 hours automatically when using monitor mode  
3. **Smart Deduplication**: Only scrapes articles it hasn't seen before
4. **Category Detection**: Automatically categorizes articles by AI topic
5. **No 404 Errors**: Fixed problematic URLs that were causing errors

## 🚀 Quick Start for Automatic Scraping

1. **Start the monitor** (this will run continuously):
   ```bash
   uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main monitor
   ```

2. **Let it run in background** - it will check for new articles every 24 hours

3. **Check status anytime**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m nvidia_scraper.main status
   ```

The scraper is now fully automated and will catch new NVIDIA AI/ML articles as they're published! 🎉
